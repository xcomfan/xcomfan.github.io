## Requests Library is not have Async support.

If you need async support check out [AIOHTTP](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/) or [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/async/)

HTTPX is broadly compatible with Requests syntax.

[comment]: <> (TODO: Use HTTPX docs to reproduce everything you are doing in this tutorial in a HTTPX doc.)

## Getting Started

Because requests is a third party library you need to install it.

`python -m pip install requests`
