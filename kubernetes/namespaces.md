## Namespaces

Namespaces Provide isolation and access control so that each microservice can control the degree to which other services interact with it. Namespaces can be used to isolate developer environments. For example instead of setting up a cluster for each developer you can have one cluster and have a namespace for each developer. This makes it conceivable to deploy and test every single commit.
