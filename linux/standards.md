## POSIX

POSIX stands for portable operating system interface and it refers to a group of standards developed under IEEE.  The goal of the standard is to promote application portability at the source code level. POSIX documents an API for a set of services that should be made available to a program by a conforming operating system. POSIX xpecifies the API, but not the implementation.

## SUSvX

SUSvX stands for single UNIX Specification Version X and it is essentially POSIX 1003.1-2001 which replaces earlier POSIX standards.
