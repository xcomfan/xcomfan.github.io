## General information

* JavaScript is case sensitive
* HTML is not case sensitive: It is an accepted practice to write HTML in all lowercase inside of JavaScript.  For example in HTML its accepted to use `onClick`, but in JavaScript you would use `onclick`.
* JavaScript does automatic garbage collecting.
* Variables are untyped and JavaScript will try to convert between types if used that way in code.
* Statements are executed.  Expressions are evaluated to produce a value.
