## Incrementing numbers

Numbers in JavaScript can be incremented and decremented with the `++`, `--`, `+=`, `-=` `*=` operators.

## Floating point numbers

To declare a decimal/floating point number use `const myDecimal = 4.2;`  All operations work the same on decimals as on integers. For example `const quotient = 4.4 / 2.2;`

## Get number from a string

Your can use the `parseInt()` function to get an integer from a string.  `const a = parseInt("007");`

You can also pass a radix argument (what base to use such as binary) `const a = parseInt("11",2);`
