<h2 id="what-is-a-git-branch">What is a Git branch?</h2>

<p>To understand branching it is helpful to have an idea of how Git stores data.</p>

<p>When you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains the following.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A pointer to a snapshot of the content you staged</li>
  <li>The commit authorâ€™s name and email address</li>
  <li>The commit message</li>
  <li>Pointers to the commit or commits that directly came before this commit (the parents)
    <ul>
      <li>Zero parents for the initial commit</li>
      <li>One parent for normal commit</li>
      <li>Multiple parents for a commit that results from a merge of two or more branches.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A branch in git is a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commit objects.</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-happens-when-i-run-the-git-branch-command">What happens when I run the git branch command.</h2>

<p>The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git branch &lt;new_branch_name&gt;</code> creates a pointer to the same commit you are currently on.  Git knows which branch you are currently on because it keeps a special pointer called HEAD that points to the branch you are currently on.</p>

<h2 id="merged-vs-unmerged-commits">Merged vs unmerged commits</h2>

<p>Note that non merged means branches that have not been merged into the named commit.  If named commit is missing HEAD is assumed.</p>

<h2 id="branching-workflows">Branching workflows</h2>

<h3 id="long-running-branches">Long running branches</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Only stable code in the master branch.  Possibly just code that has been released.</li>
  <li>There is a parallel branch named develop or next that is used to test stability.
    <ul>
      <li>This branch is not necessarily always stable, but when it gets to stable state it can be merged into master.</li>
      <li>This branch is used to pull in <a href="/gitref/definitions/#topic-branch">topic branches</a> and run them though testing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Some larger projects have a proposed or pu (proposed updates) branch that has integrated branches which may not be ready to go into the next or master branch yet.
    <ul>
      <li>The idea is that your branches have various levels of stability.  When they reach a stable level, they are merged into the branch above them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The multiple long running branches approach is helpful when you have very large or complex projects.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="topic-branches">Topic Branches</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A topic branch is a short lived branch that you create and use for a single particular feature or related work.</li>
  <li>You create a topic branch for whatever task you are working on and delete it after you merge it into the master branch.</li>
  <li>This technique lets you context switch by separating your work into branches where all work in a branch is for the branch topic.</li>
</ul>
